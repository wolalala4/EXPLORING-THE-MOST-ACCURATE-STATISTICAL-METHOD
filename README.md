In order to correctly diagnose cancer, tumors must be analyzed to determine if theyâ€™re malignant or benign so the appropriate treatment can be recommended.

Since the nuclei of cancerous cells tend to be abnormally shaped, by quantifying their morphology the type of tumor can be classified based on the physical features of the nucleus.
